# Poll plugin

The poll plugin provides the capability to include instant polling within presentations using the [`seminar` plugin](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/seminar).

## Demo

A demo of the plugin is provided at <https://rajgoel.github.io/reveal.js-demos/seminar-demo.html>. In the demo anyone can open a seminar room to become a host and share a link with the room name to anyone else. Everyone with the link can follow the hosted presentation and take part in the poll.


You may want to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-demos) of the demo presentation.
